# Miniature-Painting-Guide
A guide about painting Warhammer, DnD, and 3D printed Miniatures

## Paint Consistency
- **Consistency =** Is written as Ratio in **water:paint**
- **Base =** 25% water : 75% paint
- **Layer =** 50%, equal ratio water and paint
- **Wash =** 80% water : 20% paint. It's essentially Less Pigment, and more Water and Medium
- **Glaze =** 40% water : 60% paint
- **Drybrush =** No water, 100% paint


## Paint Components
- **Solvent =** Water, or anything that can dilute it
- **Pigment =** Gives paint color
- **Binder/Medium =**
  - *Binder*, also called a *Medium*, is an additive that binds the pigment and solvent together. It's what gives paint its properties. *Acrylic* for example, is a medium
  - Basically a transparent paint
  - It makes it easier to spread the paint, compared to adding water
  - It weakens the pigment, but still retains the properties of the paint


## Paint Additives
- **Retardant =**
  - Slows the drying time of paint 
- **Flow Improver =**
  - It makes the paint comes off the brush smoother, reduces stroke lines
  - Reduces Surface tension, it's also a *Solvent*
  - 10 : 1 water to Flow Improver
- **Glaze Medium =**
  - Vallejo's Thinner Medium: *increases flow, transparency, and slows drying time.*
  - **RECIPE :** To make your own Glaze Medium, add Half Mixing medium, and Half Distilled water in a mixing bottle. You can also add 2 drops of Flow Improver
  - **USAGE : (Army Painter Sucks)**
    - To improve your paint, take the cap off, and stir the paint around with a paper clip
    - Then shake the paint, even better with a bearing ball in the paint
    - Recommended to add 1 drop of this **Glaze Medium** to 10 drops of paint to improve it. For the whole 17ml bottle, add 3-6 drops of Glaze Medium
- **Airbrush Thinner =**
  - Helps to thining paint for **Airbrushing**. Recommended 1-2 drops of thinner to 10 drops of paint. Not for *cleaning*, but for *thinning* down paint, without losing adhesion and paint consistency
  - **RECIPE :**
    - 1/2 Cup  or 4oz Distilled Water
    - 1/4 Cup or 2oz  Isopropyl Alcohol 91 or 99%
    - 10 ml  Flow Improver
    - 1ml Retarder 
- **Airbrush Cleaner =**
  - Essentially **Alcohol** and **Ammonia**
  - 3/4 Cup or 6oz Distilled Water
  - 3/4 Cup or 6oz  Simple Green or Windex/Window Cleaner
  - 1/2 Cup or 4oz Isopropyl Alcohol 91 or 99%
  - 10 Drops or Glycerin 


## Painting Techniques
- **Layering**
  - After putting a base color, we'd use **Layer** paint consistency when adding more color
  - Paint color, then wait for it to dry. After it dries, build other colors on top of it
  - Layering can create a more interesting color hue

- **Wet Blending**
  - Put down 2 different colors of paints, and with the brush, start mixing paint towards the other color
  - Need to use **Layer** consistency, or anything wetter
  - Paint dries more quickly the more water added, so we'd also need a **retardant** to slow drying time

- **Feathering**
  - Just like Wet blending, but using water to fade away color instead of blending 2 color
  - Can use **Glaze**, **Layer**, or **Wash** consistency

- **Glazing**
  - Use this to Blend between two different colors, with a **Glaze** paint consistency
  - Semi-wet blending essentially. The paints below needs to be dry first, before glazing another color
  - Just like wet blending paint can dry quickly, so use anything that work as a paint retardant (Slow drying time)

- **Washes**
  - A wash is used to paint the creases and recesses on your miniature
  - It can also be used to tint the color of your base/layer
  - Washes is used for **Shading**, Not for **blending** colors!

- **Stipling**
  - Dab paint on surface
  - Any paint **consistency** works

- **Dry Brushing**
  - Dry brushing only works for adding highlights
  - Uses no water, 100% paint
  - After putting paint on the brush, dab some of the colors on a paper towel
